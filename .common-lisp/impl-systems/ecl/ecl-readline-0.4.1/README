Package: ECL-READLINE
Author : Jason Aquilina

Summary
=======
ECL-READLINE provides top-level readline support for ECL (Embeddable Common-Lisp) in the form of an ASDF package. It does
this by creating a CLOS input-stream that wraps around the Readline library.


Using
=====
From the top level (or in your .eclrc file)

    (require 'asdf)
    (asdf:operate 'asdf:load-op 'ecl-readline)
    (ecl-readline::enable)

Customisation
=============
ecl-readline::enable takes two keyword arguments:

    :history-file
    The name of the file for the session history - defaults to $HOME/.ecl-history.

    :history-size
    The number of history entries to keep - defaults to 100 lines
